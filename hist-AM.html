                            In the early 20th century, American colonial rule had a profound impact on Bacolor, a town in the Philippine province of Pampanga. The fact that Bacolor served as the interim capital of the Philippines during a crucial era known as the "Bacolor Republic" is one of the most important incidents in the city's history.
As a result of the United States' victory over Spain in the Spanish-American War in 1898, the Philippines were ceded to the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris. But the Filipinos had also been battling against Spanish colonial control, and they thought that the Americans would acknowledge their desire for self-governance. As Filipino forces fought American occupation, this resulted in the Philippine-American War (1899–1902).
Emilio Aguinaldo, the commander of the Philippine revolutionary forces, set his headquarters in Bacolor during the conflict. Aguinaldo was taken prisoner in 1901, though, as American soldiers took over the Philippines, effectively putting an end to organized resistance.
Bacolor had a special function at this period. The town, which had Aguinaldo's headquarters, was buried by the lahar floods that followed Mount Pinatubo's eruption in 1902. The revolutionary leaders in Bacolor, led by Macario Sakay, proclaimed the creation of the "Republic of the Philippines" in 1902 in an effort to restore some form of governance and administration. This Bacolor-based government existed until 1906, when Sakay was taken prisoner and then put to death by Americans.
